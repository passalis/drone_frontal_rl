# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Frontal View Person Shooting

![alt text](https://github.com/passalis/drone_frontal_rl/blob/master/control.png "Camera control example")


This repository contains an implementation of the Deep RL method proposed in *Deep Reinforcement Learning for Frontal View
Person Shooting using Drones*. The following are supplied:
1. An [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/)-compliant environment that can be directly used with [keras-rl](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl). This environment uses the [HPID dataset](http://www-prima.inrialpes.fr/perso/Gourier/Faces/HPDatabase.html)  to simulate the camera control commands (up, down, left, right, stay). 
2. Code to train and evaluate an RL-agent that is trained to control the camera to perform frontal shooting.
3. A [pre-trained model](https://github.com/passalis/drone_frontal_rl/blob/master/models/final.model).

To run the code:



0. Install the required dependencies (Python 3.6 was used for training/testing the models):
```
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu keras keras-rl gym
```
Also install the python bindings for [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) (or replace the calls to openCV library if you do not want to use OpenCV).
1. Download the [HPID dataset](http://www-prima.inrialpes.fr/perso/Gourier/Faces/HPDatabase.html) to 'data/datasets'.
2. Run the [preprocess_dataset.py](https://github.com/passalis/drone_frontal_rl/blob/master/preprocess_dataset.py) script to create the dataset pickle.
3. (Optionally) train the model by running the [train.py](https://github.com/passalis/drone_frontal_rl/blob/master/train.py) script.
4. Evaluate the model by running the [evaluate.py](https://github.com/passalis/drone_frontal_rl/blob/master/evaluate.py) script.

Note that the evaluation function also supports interactive evaluation. This allows for more easily examining the behavior of the agent.
